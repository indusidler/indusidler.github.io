It is always easier to come up with ideas. Thats especially true when you are young. As you get older, even idea generation can become a tough task. But in my experience, getting things done takes you much farther than thinking about ideas. 

This is especially true in the case of software development. Over the years, I have worked with various kinds of teams. Teams develop a culture of their own as things progress. This might be driven by the senior management or market pressures. They tend to prioritize different things based on incentives and constraints. Of the many themes, I have noticed, two stood out. There were teams where everything was planned well ahead and there were teams which tried out things and course corrected as they progressed. Different people call them by different names, but in my experience, the teams which tried things out seemed to have better results. Most of the times we are coaxed into forming a well defined opinion on things before we start working on them. This sounds reasonable and the right thing thing to do. This is how schools and colleges prepare us. But in reality, it is very difficult to know all the constraints before hand. We need to try a few things before we can actually know if things work the way we want them to.

And this is the approach that I have decided to take with this blog as well. See, I have been thinking of writing for a while now. I know that it is good for me. But I have always got stuck at coming up with a grand scheme for the blog. What should my blog talk about. What should I name it. What frequency should I try to write. All of these are good questions. At least they seem to be. But they prevented me from progressing. It is then I realized that I should take the agile approach to my blogging too. I should start writing and improve as I go along. Sure, this post would seem utterly idiotic in a few years time. But thats ok. If I progressed into a better writer as time progresses, I should be OK with sounding amateur here. We all need to start somewhere. Lets see where this goes.
