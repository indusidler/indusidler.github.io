So today I binge-watched Seth Godin. I have always liked his perspective on life. Some of what he says goes over my head. But I guess that's ok. One of the things he does is to write a blog post every day. As in every single day. Anyone who has ever tried writing a small essay would acknowledge that this is very hard. Writing once in a while is hard. Writing everyday is monumental. Anyways he says that he does this deliberately. He is not trying to impress anyone with his writing. He started doing this to improve his craft and to set a challenge for himself. According to him, it is this practice that has made him a better writer. Most of us don't do the work because we want assurance that our efforts would be rewarded. But life doesn't guarantee that. There is no way to know if what you are doing would lead you towards success. Only guarantee is that if you practice your craft, you are bound to become better. It would take time. More time for you than it would for someone else. But you are bound to get better. And that is the only guarantee.

I believe this to be true. And I acknowledge that it is hard to put in the practice. And absolutely frustrating if results dont show up immediately. But the trick is to be patient and to follow the process. So lets see how well I do in following the process. I have decided to put out a post every Thursday. It neednt be good. But it needs to be done by Thursday. And it should be on a topic that I have been reading/learning recently. Lets see how well I stick with it.
