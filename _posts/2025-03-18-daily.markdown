There was a time when I would only look for huge leaps in terms of progress in anything. This was my mindset. But that is not a good mindset to have. We want to make progress but that doesnt mean that we will jump to our destination. Progress doesn't happen in an instance. What is important is to move forward... consistently. It is a process. 
Everyone knows this but no one really understands this. I think it is Bill Gates who said that everyone over estimates what can be achieved in an year and underestimates the progress that can be made in five. This is a very difficult topic to grasp. On the outset it seems logical. But it is hard to accept as you are living it. We keep getting disappointed at a daily basis that we have not achieved what we wanted to. Sometimes this makes us abandon our efforts totally. That is where the problem is. If we keep working on our tasks, progress will be made. At the beginning, it might look that it is small but the law of compounding catches up.
