Does anything wait for you? It may sound like a rhetorical question. But I think everyone knows the answer for this one. Nothing waits for you. That's the truth. But it is so hard for us to accept it. We are wired to think that we are important.
We might be. For some people. Most notably our families. But other than that, no one cares and nothing stops for you. So dont overwhelm yourself. Just keep moving. Dont live in the future worrying about what people would think. They wouldn't have the time to think about you. They are busy in their own lives, protecting their own turfs. They have zero time to think about you.
Do what you are set out to do in this world, without worrying about how others react. Only thing that matters is time. The more you spend on worrying, the lesser time you will have for yourself. Discover yourself... be your authentic self. I know it is easy to say this. But the more I think about this, the more I realize that everything I tried to do for others has led to me being more miserable. The only time I felt happy is when I had fun doing whatever I was doing.
It is time to get back to that mode.
