One good thing about getting older is that we start being more observant about ourselves. At least everyone should get there. There is no point in being reactive for everything. There is a place for knee jerk reactions. That should happen when we are in grave danger. But in most cases, one should have a measured response. 

This is easier said than done. Most of the times we dont have all the information to respond the right way. This assymetry in information leads us to produce sup-optimal responses. Some people jump to conclustions where as a few others just get stuck in analysis paralysis and never make a call. In both cases, the issue is that we dont recognize that our emotions are under our control and we can respond, not react. This takes a lot of practice. Most people will never to get to this level. And that is OK. The main thing to realize is that this is possible and acknowledge that we can do better by thinking.
