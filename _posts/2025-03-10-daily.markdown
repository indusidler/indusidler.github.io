When I was a kid, my brother, our cousins and I went to a circus. It was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my childhood. Especially because we all went without any adults accompanying us. I and another cousin were old enough to take care of everyone else. It was fun. One of the things that I remembered from that day was the joker juggling what seemed like a hundred things. It seemed hard but he made it seem so easy.

Little did I know at the time that time that what he was doing was a metaphor for life. As we get older, life becomes an act of juggling. An ordinary man's life has so many layers. Family, work, friends, interests, community. The list is endless. And for the most part there are very few things that we can avoid doing. So time becomes important. We want to everything. But there is only a limited time each day.

Earlier, I would never say no to things. Even now, I barely do that. But I have been getting myself to say that its OK to say no to things. Thats the only way to manage everything. If we dont do that and have too many things to juggle, we will end up spilling them all. I would like to expand on each of things that I have to juggle in my life. But there are too many at this point and as I said, I need to make sure that I do things within a certain time. I will explore each one of them but that would be in the future.
