I cannot believe we are through with another year. This is something that I feel every year. And every year time just seems to be getting faster. It is good in one way. I think keeping ourselves busy is good. It keeps the mind fresh. It keeps us in check. If we are not busy, the mind has avenues to drown into. And that is not good. Especially in an age filled with distractions. 
I usually do not have any new year resolutions. For the most part they dont work. But I want try something new this year. I want to focus on my focus. The internet addiction has been a crazy thing in my life. I am mostly watching documentaries or educational things in YouTube. I convince myself that I am not wasting time. But I am. I am letting my mind wander into a hundred different directions. I need to stop doing that. I need to start focusing to be better. There are just too many distractions but I need  to protect my attention. That is going to be the theme for this year. It is not going to be easy but I will try. Let's see how it goes.
