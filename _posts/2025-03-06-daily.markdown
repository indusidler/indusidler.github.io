This is going to be a very small one. I have to sleep now. Been a very hectic day. Why? I dont know. Sometimes there is a lot of things that need to be done. It looks like we are able to do things fast but no. It is not possible all the time. I think I can still improve the way I do thigs. I absolutely need to get off of social media. One good thing that I have done is to remove all social media from my phone. At one time I used to spend so much time on Twitter. That is where I found some of the greatest people I know. Subject matter experts who would not even want to get their name out.
It was amazing platform. These days I dont feel the same. Even a minimal amount of time on the platform does make me feel sick. I just try to get the news as fast as I can and run away from it. 
Anyways, like I said, its too late. need to hit the bed now. I am still able to post things on a daily basis but not too proud of this one. It will get better.
