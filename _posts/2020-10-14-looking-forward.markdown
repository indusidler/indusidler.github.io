I am at a stage of life where I have a lot of things that I can look back at. All the mistakes I made keep presenting themselves everyday. They taunt me. Tell me how bad I am. Its true. But the problem with that kind of thinking is how we lose perspective of all the good we have done in life. I had absolutely no help. Nothing. Zilch. Came from a modest background and got here just through git. Not much of luck and not real world smarts. Just grit. My idealism in younger days meant I gave up so many chances. But truth be told, I learnt from them. I am now a much better person. Not in terms I am being good. But in terms of me facing life. Most of my adulthood until now was spent in a fancy world. I saw the world as I thought it should be. Now, I make a deliberate effort at looking at it as it is. And that is a huge change. That is a huge change.

I look back and see all the opportunities that I was provided and squandered. Not my fault. I wasn't ready. My mental models weren't right. But all of it is behind me now. No matter what, I cannot move back in time. I have to accept that. I only have to look forward. Things are going to be great. I am going to do great. I am not too old to give up in life. This is the most important decade in my life. Seriously. This is the most important decade in my life. I need to be strong. I need to be brave. The fact that I made mistakes before, doesnt mean that I am going to do the same in the future.
