As I grow older, the years seem to fly by. It feels like just yesterday we were ringing in 2023, and now it's already gone. This year was a mixed bag for me, with more lows than highs. But if life has taught me anything, it's not to dwell on the negatives.

The year started on a positive note as I delved into the world of homeownership. In my youth, I bought into the idea that renting was better for mobility, but I've since changed my perspective. Homeownership instills a sense of responsibility. While it may not be the most financially savvy decision for everyone, the joy of having your own space outweighs the burdens of maintenance, as long as you don't over-extend yourself.

A highlight of the year was our week-long drive along the west coast. To say the west coast is beautiful would be an understatement. I love living on the east coast with its convenient proximity to great cities and wonderful people, but the west coast is truly breathtaking. That drive will stay with me for years to come, and I hope to have the opportunity to do it again in the future.

The reason this year has been a bitter one, however, is due to the loss of my father. No one is ever truly prepared for such a loss, and it was especially hard for me as his passing was sudden and unexpected. It's been difficult to come to terms with, but life goes on. I honor his memory by remembering the good times and paying respect to my ancestors.

Professionally, this year wasn't the best. I need to refocus on my long-term goals and figure out the next steps for my career. It's easy to feel stuck, but I know the way out is through discipline. Waking up early, staying organized, and taking action are steps I need to take. So, I'm designating 2024 as my year of discipline. I'm confident I will make it happen.
