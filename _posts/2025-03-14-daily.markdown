I missed my post yesterday. This was the first weekday I missed after I started doing it. It was bound to happen someday. I worked late last night and by the time I got back it was close to midnight. I was hoping to get to my post in the train. But got distracted by an email and had to log back. So these things happen. The thing is not worry too much about them. I am going to miss a few days. Its ok. 
But there is one thing this practice has done. It has made be a better writer. I know, the posts are not great. I know I am not writing anything useful here. But doing this random writing is making me think. And I feel that I will get very good at this as days pass by. I will also start writing meaningful stuff in the future. Things will get better. At least thats the hope. Lets see.
