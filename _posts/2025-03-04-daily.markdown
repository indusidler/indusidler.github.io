One of the best finds in the recent days for me is the app named Vignanam. It is app dedicated to Indic knowledge systems and is just amazing in the way it is structured. One thing I like is the snippets it puts out everyday in the rolling widgets in the home screen of the app.
Today, I saw an interesting title. It said "Ten Qualities of Righteousness". It presented a shloka from Mahabharatam which list out of these ten qualities. What is fascinating is how relevant the qualities are even to this day. Considering that the Mahabharatam was written over 5000 years ago, it is strange to see how little human psychology has changed. 
The shloka lists Courage, Forgiveness, Judgement, Non-stealing, Cleanliness, Control of senses, Righteous action, knowledge, Truth and Aversion to anger as the ten qualities required for a living a life filled with Dharma. It doesn't take a scientist to agree that these qualities are universal. These are still relevant today as they were millennia ago. I want to remember these and follow them in my daily life as well. These are intrinsic to human beings but somewhere down the line we forget our real nature and start diverting. It is our responsibility to find the right path everyday.
